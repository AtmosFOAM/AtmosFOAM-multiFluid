This looks as if it will introduce a mass conservation error. The inconsistecy between sum(sigma rho theta) and Exner should not lead to a conservation error but currently sigmaRho is recalculated based on Exner. sigma.H needs to be redone like this:

rhoTheta = theta.sum();

and no need to do:
sigma.updateSum();
for(label ip = 0; ip < nParts; ip++)
{
    sigma[ip] /= sigma.sum();
    sigmaRho[ip] = sigma[ip]*rho[ip];
}
sigma.updateSum();

Also better diagnostics of mass conservation errors

Also there is a problem with minSigma in applyMassTransfers.H
const scalar minSigmaDiv = max(minSigma, VSMALL);

should be SMALL

Also check multiFluidBuossinesq
