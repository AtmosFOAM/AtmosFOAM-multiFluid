Done: Put all the transfers at the end in order to simplify and use variables rather than oldTime variables

Diffusion
    - sigma, b and u
done but not properly tested

Decouple mass transfer from uT and bT
    done for wTransfer but transfer functions are needed to generalise code
    need to make bT[i][j] instead of bT[i]
    
need to make S < 1/dt rather than limiting M
Check size of explicit diffusion coefficients
What transfer terms should be written out (seeing as they are re-used) - none?
How to calculate final terms written out

transfer based on db/dz

3 fluids?

Transfer to keep flagged cells uniform sigma

keepWseparate?

Think about the problem that there is probably no solution to the p=-gamma div(u) problem or simplify pEqn.H?
Possibly fixed?
