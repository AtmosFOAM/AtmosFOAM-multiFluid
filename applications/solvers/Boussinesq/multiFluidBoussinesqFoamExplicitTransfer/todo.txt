Done: Put all the transfers at the end in order to simplify and use variables rather than oldTime variables

Diffusion
    - sigma, b and u
done but not properly tested

transfer based on db/dz

Decouple mass transfer from uT and bT

3 fluids?

Transfer to keep flagged cells uniform sigma

keepWseparate?

Think about the problem that there is probably no solution to the p=-gamma div(u) problem or simplify pEqn.H?
Possibly fixed?
